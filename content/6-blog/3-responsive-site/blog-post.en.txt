Title: Less Effort 2.0

----

Text: 

Welcome to the new Less Effort site. This site is built from scratch and features loads of new stock in the shop and a fresh new design.
The site is built on Kirby CMS, which is a rather splendid CMS that is lightweight, fast and easy to use. The shop runs on CartKit - an ecommerce solution
for Kirby. 

The site is responsive on any device you visit on. Mobile is more minimal and has more of an app-like feel.
If any of the site looks broken, then you probably need to update your browser (or swap from using Internet Explorer, naughty!) 
Feedback on the site and design would be great in the comments, or on twitter
