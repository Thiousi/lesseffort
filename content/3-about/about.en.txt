## Sponsorship

We are currently not looking to sponsor anyone at the moment. The Elite are very close friends that have been helping the brand to build. Possibly in the future we may build a bigger team and look for people to sponsor, the only way we can become larger is by people purchasing our goods. However, if you feel you are absolutely at the top of your game and like the direction of the brand, then get in touch. Due to the amount of mail we receive, we may not be able to reply to each and every enquiry.

## Promotion

If you have something you feel fits in well with the brand feel free to email us about it. For example – mixtapes, shows, riding edits. If we like then it will be posted on here and the social media networks, if it is not posted please do not be offended.
